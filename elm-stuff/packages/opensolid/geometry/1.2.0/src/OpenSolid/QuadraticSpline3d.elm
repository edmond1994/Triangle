A `QuadraticSpline3d` is a quadratic [BÃ©zier curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve)
in 3D defined by three control points. This module contains functionality for

  - Evaluating points and derivatives along a spline
  - Scaling, rotating, translating or mirroring a spline
  - Converting a spline between local and global coordinates in different
    reference frames

Splines can be constructed by passing a tuple of control points to the
`QuadraticSpline3d` constructor, for example

    exampleSpline =
        QuadraticSpline3d
            ( Point3d ( 1, 1, 1 )
            , Point3d ( 3, 2, 1 )
            , Point3d ( 3, 3, 3 )
            )
